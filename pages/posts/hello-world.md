My name is Nabil Hassein and this is my mostly-technical blog.
I've been meaning to create one for about three or five years now,
so even though I'm still not totally happy with many aspects of this blog --
the styling, the layout, the absence of any analytics whatsoever,
the fact that I don't yet fully understand [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby),
the [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)-based static site generator I used to create it --
it's well past time that I start just publishing the content I want to put out there.

My most recent full-time job was at a now-defunct medical startup called Betterpath, from October 2013 to February 2016,
where I worked mostly on backend development in Scala, plus a fair amount of devops/system administration thrown in.
I gained a significant amount of knowledge and experience during that time,
but after over two years of work, there's nothing I had a hand in building that I can directly *show*.
What a shame!

Hence my renewed, and now, actualized desire to create this blog to document my projects and learnings
from my second stint at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com), still in progress as I post this.
(My first time attending was in the summer of 2013, when it was still known as Hacker School.)

Check back to learn what all those are!
