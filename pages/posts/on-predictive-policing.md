## On Predictive Policing
I gave this talk during the Recurse Center's Never Graduate Week on May 9th, 2017.

This presentation is really more of a historical and political discussion of policing in general, although the name is not a complete lie.
My primary motivation was to carve out room for a discussion of police and prison abolition in a tech space, taking racist machine learning models as a highly relevant contemporary example to motivate folks to think about our social and political obligations as technologists.

It won't give the same sense you would have gotten from also hearing me say the words to go along with it, but I think it is reasonably coherent even without that!
If nothing else, it has a lot of links to interesting documents and resources.
(There are no actual written speaker notes.)

I generated these slides using [org-reveal](https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal).
They, and the source notes, live in [a separate github repository](https://github.com/nabilhassein/slides).
