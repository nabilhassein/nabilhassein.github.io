My name is Nabil Hassein and
I am a software developer interested in way too many topics, including
web development, accessible user interfaces,
interactive maps, machine learning, security, interpreters and compilers,
distributed systems including peer-to-peer and blockchain applications,
type systems, functional programming, and modern systems programming.

This is my mostly-technical blog -- I hope you find some of what I write interesting!
You can also check out [my github](https://github.com/nabilhassein/) for more things I've worked on
than I've gotten around to documenting on this blog at any given point in time.

I was born and raised in Northern Virginia but have lived in New York City since 2008 except for one year.
I've been based in Crown Heights, Brooklyn for a few years now.

Notable among the many interesting places where I've learned many interesting things are
[New York University](https://www.nyu.edu), which I graduated in 2012 with a degree in mathematics and computer science,
and the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) (formerly known as Hacker School),
which I've attended twice, in the summer of 2013 and from late March through mid-August 2016 -- that is, currently.

I'm active in the NYC tech community -- for example, I'm one of the organizers of [!!con](bangbangcon.com).

I also do political organizing work in the movement for Black lives,
but I plan to write about such topics on this blog only to the extent
that they intersect with my work as a technologist.
You can [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/NabilHassein) if you're interested in my politics
and the other random life topics I tweet about in addition to tech.
