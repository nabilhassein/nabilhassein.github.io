## [Email](mailto:nabil.hassein@gmail.com)
I really try my best to reply to most messages within a few days!
I can't firmly promise to always do that because of the fluctuating intensity of my obligations, or even commit to replying at all to every inquiry, but all that said, email is generally the best way to contact me if we haven't spoken personally to agree otherwise.
I'm very much into advance planning, so more notice is always better for my participation in anything you would like to invite me to, even if you have to be a little vague before all details are set.

Please note that I am no longer taking on most types of freelance tech work (or considering any full-time or part-time positions) now that I am a full-time PhD student; however I am always still happy to consider public speaking and writing/publishing opportunities, as well as short-duration teaching and other special events.

## [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NabilHassein)
I don't post regularly, in part because the speed of the platform doesn't match my own slower style of processing and doing things.
But this is still one of the better ways to get in touch with me if we haven't met in person, and it's also a decent way to stay up with me if we have!

## [Instagram](https://instagram.com/nabilhassein)
I consider myself weak at visual communication compared to text, but I'm pretty open on here about my activities, and am trying to use it more consistently for promotion of events I organize.
However, DMing here is a poor way to reach me because I often uninstall the app from my phone as a means of self-discipline to guard my time, and Instagram's web interface obnoxiously does not let you check DMs, which I assume is a deliberate move by Facebook to grab more of my attention than I want it to have.

## Other
I'm typically @nabilhassein on any social platform I use, like [github](https://github.com/nabilhassein).
I don't check any of them on a regular basis besides the above two.

## That's about it
I also use numerous private channels for various communities, so you can also contact me there if we're both members of one of them, but it's really a struggle for me to keep up with so many forms of communication.
If you think I may have missed a message you sent via one of them, I won't be upset by you sending a reminder by email or some other medium I check more regularly.

Along the same lines, if you invite me to connect with you in some other way and I decline, it's not because I don't want to talk to you!
It's because I see limiting the number of forms of communication I use as my only hope of staying on top of each one.
My apologies if I fail to reply to you despite my best efforts.
